15         	Notes:
16         	- This script assumes that the imputed datasets are stored in a single dataset
17         	with an indicator variable '_imputation_' to identify each imputed dataset.
18         	- The macro RLOGIST_MI fits the GEE model for each imputed dataset and prepares the results for MIANALYZE.
19         	- Ensure that SUDAAN is properly installed and configured to run the RLOGIST procedure.
20         	- Modify the macro call at the end of the script to specify the appropriate variables and dataset names.
