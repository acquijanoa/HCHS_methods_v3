15         Notes:
16         - This script assumes that the imputed datasets are stored in a single dataset
17         with an indicator variable '_imputation_' to identify each imputed dataset.
18         - The macro GEE_SUDAAN fits the GEE model for each imputed dataset and prepares the results for MIANALYZE.
19         - Ensure that SUDAAN is properly installed and configured to run the REGRESS procedure.
20         - Modify the macro call at the end of the script to specify the appropriate variables and dataset names.
